      <p>Obviously that didn&#8217;t go well. The continuance of blogging that is. The half went really well, we aren&#8217;t the fastest in the bunch, but we finished and that&#8217;s what really matters right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking at some other static site generators, a task that stemmed from a conversation with a friend of mine, and I&#8217;ve not been able to find one that just works well. <span>http://jekyllrb.com</span> which is what this site is built in, works pretty well I suppose but if you look at my github repo (where i&#8217;m keeping this), you will notice that I have a master and a dev branch. Sure that&#8217;s not exactly required, but I do it because I want a clean set of HTML files for static content.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d like is a tool, much like jekyll, but has a bit smaller learning curve. Something that I can update super easily and that doesn&#8217;t take some reverse engineering to get all working properly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably just continue to use jekyll and wrap some more tools around it (like my publish.sh script) to make life easier.</p>

      <h2><a href="/training-for-the-half" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">Training for the half</a></h2>
      <span>July 12, 2014</span>
      <p>A couple years ago I started running in the morning. Running, but never seriously. It was just a way to lose a bit of weight and to start getting healthier. Then, I went on vacation and it was tougher to run so I got out of the habit.</p>

<p>My wife started signing us up for little fun runs, 5K mud runs and the likes. These were fun, and we had a great time doing them. We went into each of these without any sort of training and well, as you can imagine, we were pretty tired when we finished. So when she decided that we were going rachet it up and signed us up for a half marathon I was a bit worried.</p>

<p>I figure we can do it though if we train, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve started doing. Using a tracker and training schedule we&#8217;ve officially started our training today. We missed the first two days this week being on vacation, not a good start, but today we each ran our 3 miles and tomorrow is 5 miles. It was a pretty rough run but hopefully it will get easier.</p>

      <h2><a href="/back-again" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">Back again</a></h2>
      <span>June 19, 2014</span>
      <p>Well back at this again. I&#8217;m looking for a side project to work on, something that I&#8217;ll have fun with, something that I&#8217;ll use. I&#8217;ve been looking through my list of documents that contain the word &#8216;Idea&#8217; in the title and while I think a couple of them would be cool, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d use them much.</p>

<p>The one thing that I keep finding is that I like to track things. I&#8217;ve seen quite a few other posts about people tracking every aspect of their life and have even seen companies built around this. While this is fun to do, it&#8217;s something that is pretty time consuming and I don&#8217;t really want to have to take out my phone each time I fill my cup of coffee.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;m going to start writing a bit more. (let&#8217;s see how that really goes)</p>

      <h2><a href="/getting-back-to-it" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">Getting back to it</a></h2>
      <span>November  5, 2013</span>
      <p>I&#8217;ve been away from blogging on my personal blog for way too long and now it&#8217;s time to get back to it. Some things have changed recently that have restricted my time but now I&#8217;m looking to remedy that and reclaim my &#8220;Me&#8221; time. My &#8220;Me&#8221; time is the time in which I hack on after-hours projects and generally go about the task of learning new things. I&#8217;ve been sorely missing this time and unfortunately I think I&#8217;ve been taking it out on others.</p>

<p>So&#8230; What&#8217;s on the docket?</p>

<p>I really have no idea but I&#8217;m excited to get started with a couple ideas that I&#8217;ve been kicking around to see how viable they really are. The one thing I need to remember to do though <em>FOCUS</em></p>
