I'm now getting used to the idea that I can post a blog at the same place where I do much of my development. Pretty cool actually.\r\n \r\n### Why GitHub and not another platform such as Drupal?\r\nI have a few places on the web, most using Drupal or some other blogging platform. Mostly I'm not using Drupal as an anything more than a blogging platform. Since this is the case, I figured I'd just use GitHub for now.\r\n\r\n### So what?\r\nSo nothing really, I will not likely be doing much here by way of blogging, though that may change. I'm initially setting this up as a place to test an idea that I have, nothing more.\r\n","name":"Aaron Ott","google":"UA-34134855-1"}
