Today I'm at one of my favorite places to be. Though not this particular
branch but the Library is one of the greatest places there is. I feel saddened
at the prospect that buildings such as this may be extinct in the future and
feel that there is hope for these places as well. For the most part, many of
the libraries have adapted to the times in allowing for free wifi access to
any of it's patrons and quite a bit of good quite sitting space.

I love reading but don't read many tree books any longer, most books that I
read are the digital version unless I need it for reference. I don't use the
library as a place to checkout books but more as a place to get things done.
At the library you are free to sit without the distraction of cleaning the
dishes or that other project around the house that has been sitting rotting to
get done. The feeling is liberating really.

So I sit here for about 3hrs today and am able to work on a few digital
projects that I've been trying to get to but have been a bit distracted at
home. One of the projects is this page actually so I'm not wasting any time by
writing this up right quick. I'm still learning this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) thing but am
really enjoying each step. With that, it's time to get at it.
