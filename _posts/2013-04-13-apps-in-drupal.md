Following up on last months presentation on [Drupal distributions](http://a.aronott.com/drupal/distributions-in-drupal) 
at DBUG I presented this month on [Drupal Apps](http://prezi.com/ru-qvlaseye5/drupal-apps/?kw=view-ru-qvlaseye5&rc=ref-37411643).

Drupal apps are a great way to build and capture pieces of functionality that
fit a single use-case. Good apps are things like Events, Blog and Photos
because they solve a single problem.

During the presentation I pointed out that things solving more than a single
problem would not make a good app. Things like views, panels and tokens fall
into this category. While these are great modules and can be used to build
apps, they themselves would not make good apps since their functionality is
too broad.

At the end of the presentation I pointed to the following links to learn more
about what an app is and how to build one.
