I've been away from blogging on my personal blog for way too long and now it's time to get back to it. Some things have changed recently that have restricted my time but now I'm looking to remedy that and reclaim my "Me" time. My "Me" time is the time in which I hack on after-hours projects and generally go about the task of learning new things. I've been sorely missing this time and unfortunately I think I've been taking it out on others.

So... What's on the docket?

I really have no idea but I'm excited to get started with a couple ideas that I've been kicking around to see how viable they really are. The one thing I need to remember to do though *FOCUS*
