A couple years ago I started running in the morning. Running, but never
seriously. It was just a way to lose a bit of weight and to start getting
healthier. Then, I went on vacation and it was tougher to run so I got out of
the habit.

My wife started signing us up for little fun runs, 5K mud runs and the likes.
These were fun, and we had a great time doing them. We went into each of these
without any sort of training and well, as you can imagine, we were pretty
tired when we finished. So when she decided that we were going rachet it up
and signed us up for a half marathon I was a bit worried.

I figure we can do it though if we train, so that's what we've started doing.
Using a tracker and training schedule we've officially started our training
today. We missed the first two days this week being on vacation, not a good
start, but today we each ran our 3 miles and tomorrow is 5 miles. It was a
pretty rough run but hopefully it will get easier.
