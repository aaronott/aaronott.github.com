Well back at this again. I'm looking for a side project to work on, something
that I'll have fun with, something that I'll use. I've been looking through my
list of documents that contain the word 'Idea' in the title and while I think
a couple of them would be cool, I don't think I'd use them much.

The one thing that I keep finding is that I like to track things. I've seen
quite a few other posts about people tracking every aspect of their life and
have even seen companies built around this. While this is fun to do, it's
something that is pretty time consuming and I don't really want to have to
take out my phone each time I fill my cup of coffee.

For now I'm going to start writing a bit more. (let's see how that really
goes)
