Obviously that didn't go well. The continuance of blogging that is. The half
went really well, we aren't the fastest in the bunch, but we finished and
that's what really matters right?

I'm looking at some other static site generators, a task that stemmed from a
conversation with a friend of mine, and I've not been able to find one that
just works well. Jekyll which is what this site is
built in, works pretty well I suppose but if you look at my github repo (where
i'm keeping this), you will notice that I have a master and a dev branch. Sure
that's not exactly required, but I do it because I want a clean set of HTML
files for static content.

What I'd like is a tool, much like jekyll, but has a bit smaller learning
curve. Something that I can update super easily and that doesn't take some
reverse engineering to get all working properly. 

I'll probably just continue to use jekyll and wrap some more tools around it
(like my publish.sh script) to make life easier.
