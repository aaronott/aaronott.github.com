## A new home

I've been using GitHub for a while for hosting personal projects and I really like it. I'm now getting used to the idea that I can post a blog at the same place where I do much of my development. Pretty cool actually.

## Why GitHub and not another platform such as Drupal?

I have a few places on the web, most using Drupal or some other blogging platform. Mostly I'm not using Drupal as an anything more than a blogging platform. Since this is the case, I figured I'd just use GitHub for now.

## So what?

So nothing really, I will not likely be doing much here by way of blogging, though that may change. I'm initially setting this up as a place to test an idea that I have, nothing more.
