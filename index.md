## A new day

I'm moving my content and blog posts over to github. The reason for this is
pretty simple, I want a place that can host my blog for free and I get quite a
few perks using github to do it.

Using github allows me to play around with other technologies such as jekyll
to build my blog. [Jekyll] allows me to create a blog post in [markdown] and
post it on github as a static html file. Not cool? Actually is WAY cool becase
I can also do comments and analytics along with it.

## Why not use Drupal?

I am a firm believer that each tool has it's use and Drupal is a great tool.
Drupal is like a [swiss army knife] in that you can have quite a bit of
functionality in a single system. For this blog I choose to have more of a
Ginsu knife which is a tool that is only useful at one thing, cutting.

Using Github I don't need to worry about upgrading or updating anything at
all. I just create my blog post and git push it and it shows up. Since it's a
static HTML page, I don't need to be worried about modules that are insecure.

## So what?

Nothing really. I'm just going to be blogging on a few topics, starting out
mostly with Drupal since it's something I know a bit about, and moving on to
other things. If there are any suggestions about something that I should blog
about, please feel free to hit up the [issue queue] on my github repo that is
storing all this wonderful content.
