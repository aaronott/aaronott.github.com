   <title>Training for the half</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I started running in the morning. Running, but never seriously. It was just a way to lose a bit of weight and to start getting healthier. Then, I went on vacation and it was tougher to run so I got out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife started signing us up for little fun runs, 5K mud runs and the likes. These were fun, and we had a great time doing them. We went into each of these without any sort of training and well, as you can imagine, we were pretty tired when we finished. So when she decided that we were going rachet it up and signed us up for a half marathon I was a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure we can do it though if we train, so that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;ve started doing. Using a tracker and training schedule we&amp;#8217;ve officially started our training today. We missed the first two days this week being on vacation, not a good start, but today we each ran our 3 miles and tomorrow is 5 miles. It was a pretty rough run but hopefully it will get easier.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well back at this again. I&amp;#8217;m looking for a side project to work on, something that I&amp;#8217;ll have fun with, something that I&amp;#8217;ll use. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking through my list of documents that contain the word &amp;#8216;Idea&amp;#8217; in the title and while I think a couple of them would be cool, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d use them much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I keep finding is that I like to track things. I&amp;#8217;ve seen quite a few other posts about people tracking every aspect of their life and have even seen companies built around this. While this is fun to do, it&amp;#8217;s something that is pretty time consuming and I don&amp;#8217;t really want to have to take out my phone each time I fill my cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;#8217;m going to start writing a bit more. (let&amp;#8217;s see how that really goes)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been away from blogging on my personal blog for way too long and now it&amp;#8217;s time to get back to it. Some things have changed recently that have restricted my time but now I&amp;#8217;m looking to remedy that and reclaim my &amp;#8220;Me&amp;#8221; time. My &amp;#8220;Me&amp;#8221; time is the time in which I hack on after-hours projects and generally go about the task of learning new things. I&amp;#8217;ve been sorely missing this time and unfortunately I think I&amp;#8217;ve been taking it out on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; What&amp;#8217;s on the docket?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really have no idea but I&amp;#8217;m excited to get started with a couple ideas that I&amp;#8217;ve been kicking around to see how viable they really are. The one thing I need to remember to do though &lt;em&gt;FOCUS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Easy Jekyll push to Github with plugins</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/jekyll/easy-jekyll-push-to-github-with-plugins"/>
   <updated>2013-04-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/jekyll/easy-jekyll-push-to-github-with-plugins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I was looking at a way to create a &amp;#8220;Readmore&amp;#8221; link on the front page of this blog. This allows for me to have a nice dynamic listing on the front page without having to display the entire contents of each blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#8217;m new to Jekyll and don&amp;#8217;t have much experience with Ruby either, I looked to the webs assuming that I&amp;#8217;m not the first one to think of such crazy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran across a few different posts including &lt;a href='http://www.jacquesf.com/2011/03/creating-excerpts-in-jekyll-with-wordpress-style-more-html-comments/'&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which I ended up using. So I created the postmore.rb file in my _plugins directory and BAM! it worked just like I wanted. I made the modifications to some of my more recent posts and tested everything locally. Everything was looking great so I pushed up to Github only to find that things were now looking different. Some investigation revealed that Github doesn&amp;#8217;t run 3rd party plugins so I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to be able to use the solution that I was very recently so excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ok Internets, let&amp;#8217;s try this again.&amp;#8221; Again assuming that I&amp;#8217;m not the first one to run into this issue I set out to find a solution. I actually ran across many different really good solutions but decided on &lt;a href='http://edhedges.com/blog/2012/07/30/jekyll-with-plugins-hosted-on-github-pages/'&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/Dwedard'&gt;Eddie Hedges&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d highly recommed you read Eddies description as well as the original answer he got from &lt;a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/11679993/1813873'&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this solution because it takes the _site directory in the dev branch and points the master branch to it. This reduces the amount of files remaining in master and always ensures that it is simple to setup your site anywhere with the static html files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even created a quick publish.sh script that contains the one-liner because I&amp;#8217;m horrible with remember all the commands there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps others out as much as it has me. Please feel free to let me know of any other great solutions you&amp;#8217;ve found to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Apps in Drupal</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/drupal/apps-in-drupal"/>
   <updated>2013-04-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/drupal/apps-in-drupal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on last months presentation on &lt;a href='http://a.aronott.com/drupal/distributions-in-drupal'&gt;Drupal distributions&lt;/a&gt; at DBUG I presented this month on &lt;a href='http://prezi.com/ru-qvlaseye5/drupal-apps/?kw=view-ru-qvlaseye5&amp;amp;rc=ref-37411643'&gt;Drupal Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal apps are a great way to build and capture pieces of functionality that fit a single use-case. Good apps are things like Events, Blog and Photos because they solve a single problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the presentation I pointed out that things solving more than a single problem would not make a good app. Things like views, panels and tokens fall into this category. While these are great modules and can be used to build apps, they themselves would not make good apps since their functionality is too broad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the presentation I pointed to the following links to learn more about what an app is and how to build one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://groups.drupal.org/open-app-standard/oas'&gt;Open App Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Super shortcuts to useful pages</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/shortcuts"/>
   <updated>2013-04-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/shortcuts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bookmarks are great for taking you back to a page that you&amp;#8217;ve been to before, but what about those pages that you frequent daily. I find myself heading on over to &lt;a href='http://php.net'&gt;php.net&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href='http://api.drupal.org'&gt;api.drupal.org&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit to look up different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue that I have going directly to these pages is that I have to type in the url into the browser, then search for the function I want. I suppose I could type in the function into Google (or the browser search) and click on the first entry that comes back, but I like making thinks a bit easier for me. Imagine you are using the &lt;a href='http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php'&gt;date&lt;/a&gt; function and can&amp;#8217;t remember if you need to use &amp;#8216;r&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;c&amp;#8217; in your function. Using the regular search way, you could type in php date in the search field, or you could head on over to &lt;a href='http://php.net'&gt;php.net&lt;/a&gt; and search there. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be easier to simply type php date in your browser bar and have it take you directly to that page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome allows you to do just that by setting up your own custom search (even though you&amp;#8217;re not really searching). If you are in the Chrome browser now, you can try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the wrench &amp;#8216;Customize&amp;#8217; button and click on Preferences. A little more than half way down, you will find the &amp;#8216;Search&amp;#8217; section with a button labeled &amp;#8216;Manage Search Engines&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;. Clicking on this brings up an overlay with two sections, &amp;#8216;Default search options&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Other search engines&amp;#8217; for our case we are interested in the second one. Scroll to the very bottom where you will find a row of three text entry boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first box enter php.net - this is the label of your search so you can call it whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second box php - this is the shortcut text that will invoke the search engine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third box http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.%s.php - when we search for date on the php.net page, we notice it takes us to http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php so if we use the %s as our string placeholder, we only need to type in the name of the function to get that url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to use php date on your own browser, and yes you can search for any of the other php functions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple more of my shortcuts:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Distributions in Drupal</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/drupal/distributions-in-drupal"/>
   <updated>2013-03-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/drupal/distributions-in-drupal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a presentation on Distributions (or Installation Profiles) at the local Drupal Meetup and touched at a higher level about what these can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting out in Drupal some time ago I was pretty excited. I downloaded Drupal, installed it and then&amp;#8230; well I had that feeling &amp;#8220;Ok now what?&amp;#8221; I wasn&amp;#8217;t really sure what all could be done with Drupal or what I wanted to do with Drupal so kind of left it at that for a bit. Luckily I was using it at work for a different project where we built custom module after custom module and added them to our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think quite a few people feel this way. They hear about Drupal from someone who may be excited about it &amp;#8220;Hey you&amp;#8217;re building a such-and-such site? You&amp;#8217;ve gotta checkout Drupal, it would be perfect for that.&amp;#8221; So they go home, download and install Drupal and say to themselves&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;Ok now what?&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Distributions are a great place to start. First off, you get much more functionality than the out-of-the-box installation and you can choose a distribution that is close to what you are trying to build. One of the biggest benefits I find of distributions is that you can install it then take a look at all the modules used to create the great functionality you are looking for. This is a great learning tool in that you can see what modules work well with other modules and find the answer to just how did they build that super cool slideshow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation we walked through four different distributions with varying levels of complexity. We started off with a pretty simple distribution and worked up to a very well polished distribution that can be used with very little customization needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='jumpstart'&gt;Jumpstart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first distribution we looked at was the Jumpstart distribution which is pretty simple by design. The purpose of this distribution is to have a starting point to build sites. Instead of requiring that you download and install Drupal, then download Views and some development modules separately, this Distribution takes care of that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/assets/images/jumpstart_ss.png' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of a personal distribution that can be created to have a good jumping off point to create your projects. There aren&amp;#8217;t any added features with this distro so it really is just something to use while at the beginning of a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://drupal.org/project/jumpstart'&gt;Jumpstart project page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='openpublish'&gt;OpenPublish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenPublish aims to bring all the required tools for building a publishing centric site such as a news site. While there is no sample content, this distribution adds a couple different content types for Blog post, photo galleries, and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/assets/images/publish_ss.png' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distribution includes features exported using the features module allowing for the distribution to create views and other pieces out of the box. Features in this distribution are used to build the different content types and modify the users profiles as well as creating a default view for content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece we didn&amp;#8217;t touch on but that is interesting is the fact that this distribution also includes the apps module. This allows the site builder to download prepackaged fully functional applications to add even more functionality to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://drupal.org/project/openpublish'&gt;OpenPublish project page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='drupal_commons'&gt;Drupal Commons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved on to the great Drupal Commons distribution. This distribution is created to include a community site. Out of the box this distribution allows for the creation and display of events, subscription to different groups and even a wiki for each group. There are many other features that are included in this distribution that make customization easier on the site builder. For instance this distribution uses panels for layout which allows you to drag and drop your displays to different sections on the screen. The appearance section includes quite a few customizations that can be made to the layout and css of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/assets/images/commons_ss.png' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first distribution we looked at that also installed sample content which gives the site builder a much better idea of the layout and flow of the site. This is a great distribution to download an look at if you are looking at adding &amp;#8220;Hot Topics&amp;#8221; to your site. It uses the radioactivity module to keep track of those stories and articles that people want to to read on your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://network.acquia.com/downloads/drupal-commons'&gt;OpenPublish project page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='commerce_kickstart'&gt;Commerce Kickstart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we installed and looked at the Commerce Kickstart distribution. This distribution was built as an example of what can be done with the Commerce module and is a great place to start if you are looking at building an online commerce store. Included in this distribution is everything you will need setup your store, take payments and ship your product. While this distribution doesn&amp;#8217;t include any apps, it does make good use of the Features module and builds many different content types and views to display your products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/assets/images/commerce_ss.png' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with sample content, this distribution also has a great help section that include videos and step-by-step how-to&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of commerce, it is a great example of what can be done to customize the installation process to fit the needs of your distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart'&gt;Commerce Kickstart project page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='conclusion'&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing distributions is a great place for those that are new to Drupal and would like to get into building different sites with it. They allow new (and seasoned) users the opportunity to dig into the pre-packaged site and figure out how the features and functionalities are built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have been building Drupal sites for a while, it will give them ideas on creating a distribution allowing for a good starting point to cut down the level of work they will need to complete on each of their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know of other distributions that you&amp;#8217;ve run into that are good for learning or that do something really cool.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I was sitting at a coffee shop chatting with a &lt;a href='http://danomanion.com/'&gt;good friend&lt;/a&gt; about different technologies. We had a great time chatting about Drupal, Markdown and other great techs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we talked about was JavaScript and the different frameworks that are available for it. It seems to me that there may actually be too many choices. With all these choices, which one do I choose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve chosen to just learn one and use it a bit and not stress out about which is the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; one to use. So backbone is the one for now. If anyone has any nice tutorials for backbone it would be appreciated. I&amp;#8217;ve gone through a couple and am still lost so I think I&amp;#8217;m missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Getting the repl_lag from your MongoDB Replication set.</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/MongoDB%20Tools/getting-the-repl_lag-from-your-mongodb-replication-set"/>
   <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/MongoDB%20Tools/getting-the-repl_lag-from-your-mongodb-replication-set</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to mongodb.org:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Replication lag is a delay between an operation on the primary and the
application of that operation from the oplog to the secondary. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB has an eventually consistent model of replication. This is just fine most of the time. Sometimes though, it&amp;#8217;s interesting to find out just how far behind your secondaries are from the primary. This can be done by comparing the optime in the replication status (&lt;code&gt;rs.status()&lt;/code&gt;) output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to run an rs.status() then grab the optime from the primary and subtract the optime of the secondary node I was interested in. This is a pain and too time consuming. For this reason I wrote the following command that can be run from the mongo commandline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rs.repl_lag = function () {
  var s = db._adminCommand(&amp;quot;replSetGetStatus&amp;quot;);
 
  // if this is primary, go no further.
  if (s.myState == 1) {
    return 0;
  }
 
  var mytime = 0;
  var primarytime = 0;
 
  for (var i in s.members) {
    if (s.members[i].self == true) {
      mytime = s.members[i].optime.t;
    }
 
    if (s.members[i].stateStr == &amp;quot;PRIMARY&amp;quot;) {
      primarytime = s.members[i].optime.t;
    }
 
    if (mytime &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; primarytime &amp;gt; 0) {
      break;
    }
  }
 
  return (primarytime - mytime) / 1000;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this, call mongo using the &amp;#8211;shell parameter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mongo --shell repl_lag.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then from the prompt all you need to type is &lt;code&gt;rs.repl_lag()&lt;/code&gt; and the command returns the number of seconds behind the primary that the current node is. You&amp;#8217;ll notice that if we are on the primary, we simply return 0 since it can&amp;#8217;t be behind itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script can be downloaded from &lt;a href='https://gist.github.com/aaronott/5045018'&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Clean up Drupal Users</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/drupal/clean-up-drupal-users"/>
   <updated>2013-02-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/drupal/clean-up-drupal-users</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many times when deploying a Drupal site from your development or staging environment to the production environment, there is the desire to clean things up in order to boost security. One thing that should not be forgotten is the users that are allowed to login to the site. If you have a deployment where everything happens on the development or staging server and is pushed to production, it would be a good idea to not allow any users to login directly to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ways to go about this, the first is by logging in as the admin user and manually blocking all users. This method is fine if there are only a few users, but it also becomes tedious and if there are more than a few, very time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to do it would be to login to the database and run something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE users SET status = 0 WHERE uid &amp;gt; 1;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this method works just fine, but since we are inside a Drupal instance, we can let Drush do the work for us. I&amp;#8217;ve created a short script that can be used for this purpose and all it does is block every user except the Administrator and Anonymous users. The reason we block the user instead of canceling the user is we might like blog posts to remain tied to the user so they would get credit on the by-line otherwise all content is re-assigned to the Anonymous user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the script looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env drush
&amp;lt;?php
#
# This script removes all drupal users with uid &amp;gt; 1 (e.g., skips
# admin user) and reassigns their content to anonymous.
#

// check if we can bootstrap
$self = drush_sitealias_get_record(&amp;#39;@self&amp;#39;);
if (empty($self)) {
  drush_die(&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t bootstrap from the current location.&amp;quot;, 0);
}

   <title>workingon   Time tracking</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/workingon---time-tracking"/>
   <updated>2013-01-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/workingon---time-tracking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since starting with AppliedTrust and sometime before that as well, I&amp;#8217;ve found the need to track time for different projects. I&amp;#8217;ve used a number of methods including pencil and paper, online applications, applications over xmpp that I can connect with through IM even desktop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found was that it is super easy to start the timer, then get off onto another project totally forgetting to mark the time when you ended the previous project. This leads to very inaccurate time tracking as you are trying to rely on your memory, &amp;#8220;Hmmm, how long have I been working on this?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a script that I&amp;#8217;ve written over and over to learn different languages and wrote it out in PHP real quick. I didn&amp;#8217;t really want to spend much time working on the script it self, really I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure that I&amp;#8217;d even really use it at all. I called WorkingOn and started to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start an activity I would simply type in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;workingon start &amp;quot;Project X&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this writes a temporary file with a timestamp and the project name so I can keep track of what I&amp;#8217;ve been working on and how long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at anytime I need to see what project I&amp;#8217;m tracking time against I can type in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;workingon current&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this would return something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Project X since 10:52:06 [1h13m]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a nice message telling me everything I need to know, what I&amp;#8217;m working on, when I started it and just for ease, how long I&amp;#8217;ve been working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get done I can type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;workingon end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a message like the following will be displayed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ended: Project X after 1h15m27s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built in a limitation that will allow me to only track a single task at a time. I think this is ideal since you can&amp;#8217;t focus all your energy on more than one project at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='laziness'&gt;Laziness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ran with this for a while and realized a few things. Number one, I got sick of typing out the full name &lt;code&gt;workingon start&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;workingon
current&lt;/code&gt; so I created aliases&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias wo=&amp;#39;workingon&amp;#39;
alias woc=&amp;#39;workingon current&amp;#39;
alias wor=&amp;#39;workingon report&amp;#39;
alias wos=&amp;#39;workingon start&amp;#39;
alias woe=&amp;#39;workingon end&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can simply type &lt;code&gt;wos &amp;quot;project X&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and git things started and a quick &lt;code&gt;woc&lt;/code&gt; will tell me what I&amp;#8217;m currently workingon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was progress but another thing I noticed is, like other applications, I would forget to change the clock and would find that I&amp;#8217;d type &lt;code&gt;woc&lt;/code&gt; and it would say I&amp;#8217;d been working on an application for 6hours when really I&amp;#8217;d worked on a number of projects during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='reminders'&gt;Reminders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that reminders are a good thing so I built them using cron on my system. I&amp;#8217;m using a linux system so I created a cron to run every 20 minutes and run a script called reminder.sh. This script used notify-send to popup a message that would say &amp;#8220;Hey, what are you workingon?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked for a bit but I figured, this could be better, so I added the output from &lt;code&gt;woc&lt;/code&gt; to the script so I could say, you are currently working on Project X for 1h15m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

CURRENT=`/usr/local/bin/workingon current`

/usr/bin/notify-send &amp;quot;What are you WorkingOn?&amp;quot; \
  &amp;quot;Check your time.\n $CURRENT&amp;quot; \
  -i /usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-set-time.png&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cron looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/20 7-17 * * 1-5 DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/local/bin/reminder.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id='anywhere'&gt;Anywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I found that I would be on different computers through out the day and I would like to track my time across them. Easy enough, since the database is simply a flat file, I put it in a dropbox that is connected across my computers so I can now track time on all my devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full script can be found &lt;a href='https://github.com/aaronott/WorkingOn-CLI'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone else as much as it&amp;#8217;s helped me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Securing ownership of Drupal filesystem.</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/drupal/securing-ownership-of-drupal-filesystem"/>
   <updated>2013-01-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/drupal/securing-ownership-of-drupal-filesystem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a security vulnerability found in Drupal 7.0 - 7.15 where a Drupal site could be hijacked given the wrong permissions to the settings.php file. Read more about it here &lt;a href='http://drupal.org/node/1815912'&gt;http://drupal.org/node/1815912&lt;/a&gt; if you are still running Drupal 7.15 or less, upgrade is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability relies on the settings.php file being writable by the web server. One way to ensure that these types of vulnerabilities don&amp;#8217;t effect your site is to set proper permissions to your install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my server, I will normally create a dev group and assign myself and other developers to that group. Then I set the permissions as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with all files :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chown -R nobody:dev /path/to/drupal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set the owner to all files to nobody. This is a special user in linux and will ensure that no unnecessary permissions are granted to any of the files in the Drupal install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we set directory and file permissions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// start with the files
sudo chmod -R 664 /path/to/drupal
// now set the directories
sudo find /path/to/drupal -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few final touches to make sure Drupal is happy with how things are set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// set the sites/default/files directory ownership
// www-data is the owner on most debian based systems,
// if you use a redhat based distro, you may need to set 
// the owner to &amp;#39;apache&amp;#39;
sudo chown -R www-data /path/to/drupal/sites/default/files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just for a bit more security let&amp;#8217;s make the settings.php file read-only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo chmod 444 /path/to/drupal/sites/default/settings.php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should do it, permissions should now be set such that anyone in the dev group will be able modify files as needed for development purposes but the webserver will not have permission to modify files leaving the install a bit more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole script can be be downloaded &lt;a href='https://gist.github.com/3908003'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>The Library</title>
   <link href="http://a.aronott.com/the-library"/>
   <updated>2013-01-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://a.aronott.com/the-library</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m at one of my favorite places to be. Though not this particular branch but the Library is one of the greatest places there is. I feel saddened at the prospect that buildings such as this may be extinct in the future and feel that there is hope for these places as well. For the most part, many of the libraries have adapted to the times in allowing for free wifi access to any of its patrons and quite a bit of good quite sitting space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love reading but don&amp;#8217;t read many tree books any longer, most books that I read are the digital version unless I need it for reference. I don&amp;#8217;t use the library as a place to checkout books but more as a place to get things done. At the library you are free to sit without the distraction of cleaning the dishes or that other project around the house that has been sitting rotting to get done. The feeling is liberating really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sit here for about 3hrs today and am able to work on a few digital projects that I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to get to but have been a bit distracted at home. One of the projects is this page actually so I&amp;#8217;m not wasting any time by writing this up right quick. I&amp;#8217;m still learning this &lt;a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; thing but am really enjoying each step. With that, it&amp;#8217;s time to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;by Garrett (killtheliterate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RequireJS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing project in reusable modules is very important. Not seen as much in Drupal with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript module Things are wrapped in a function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript Module can return something back to the Global Namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://briancray.com/posts/javascript-module-pattern'&gt;http://briancray.com/posts/javascript-module-pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-in-Depth'&gt;http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-in-Depth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id='asynchronous_module_definition'&gt;Asynchronous Module Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t polute the global namespace Javascript loads synchronously which can lead to slower loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal has an issue here, you would need to print out the javascript array and re-weight scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging becomes easier when modularizing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD Links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD'&gt;https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-in-Depth'&gt;http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-in-Depth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD is a method not a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an AMD module you need to be able to load it. RequireJS helps you do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RequireJS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages modulalr code&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;encourages file organization&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;leverages AMD&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Offers optimization tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rjs - RequireJS optimization tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='requirejs__drupal'&gt;RequireJS &amp;amp; Drupal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RequireJS is a bit tougher to get into Drupal but it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple threads around adding the JavaScript to Drupal but there isn&amp;#8217;t a large backing.&lt;/p&gt;
